compile() - Python Built-in Function

Description:
Compile source into a code object that can be executed by exec() or eval().

The source code may represent a Python module, statement or expression.
The filename will be used for run-time error messages.
The mode must be 'exec' to compile a module, 'single' to compile a
single (interactive) statement, or 'eval' to compile an expression.
The flags argument, if present, controls which future statements influence
the compilation of the code.
The dont_inherit argument, if true, stops the compilation inheriting
the effects of any future statements in effect in the code calling
compile; if absent or false these statements do influence the compilation,
in addition to any features explicitly specified.

# Examples:

# Compiles source into code object
code = compile('print("Hello")', '<string>', 'exec')
exec(code)  # Hello
