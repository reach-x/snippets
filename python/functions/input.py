input() - Python Built-in Function

Description:
Read a string from standard input.  The trailing newline is stripped.

The prompt string, if given, is printed to standard output without a
trailing newline before reading input.

If the user hits EOF (*nix: Ctrl-D, Windows: Ctrl-Z+Return), raise EOFError.
On *nix systems, readline is used if available.
