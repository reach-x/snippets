I want an ios weather monitoring app named Temp Monitor Pro TempMonitorPro.com that will tell me when it's a certain
temperature outside. I'd like it to use xcode
and swift to build this out.

There can be up to 10 locations being monitored and the ability to monitor your current location.
The alerts can be customized but the default message is "$Location has (warmed up or cooled down) to $degrees"

The temperature going up or going down going down has entered within the range of X to Y degrees
It will need to be able to check the temperature every 15 minutes ideally using some apple weather service. There will
be a configuration where we can give it a single location to check or it monitors your current location.

I want a one shot prompt for claude code to build this out for me. Make the prompt downloadable.
